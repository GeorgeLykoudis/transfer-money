# Transfer Money API
This application exposes an api at http://localhost:8080/api/transaction in order to transfer
money from account to the other. 

At the beginning of the application few accounts are being created in order to test the application. 
There is a postman collection (transfer money.postman_collection.json) in the repository with samples.
